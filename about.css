All my life I knew I was going to be something
great. I went down a lot of career paths in 
my lifetime, and my end goal has always been 
to find something im happy doing. I want to wake
up and be excited about what I do for a living.
I dont want it to feel like work at all because
I genuienly enjoy doing it.
